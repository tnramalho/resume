## CV

That's my personal resume created using react and bootstrapped by create-react-app. [Tap here to see.](https://fmacedoo.github.com/resume).

## Motivation

I got tired to keep my word based CV document and decided to create that one as an app, online and based on a json file with my personal and professional data.

## How about...

How about to help me to grown it as a free tool that generates CVs using a form to capture the data and a theme based scheme. Some unemployed people would appreciate.

Do you know some free and open tool that already do that? Tell me, i could be helping!
